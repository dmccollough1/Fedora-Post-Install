Fedora Post Install Scripts
===========================

A semi-automatic and interactive set of post-installation scripts for Fedora and its derivatives. You can use this project to install your favourite apps, set your preferred settings, and do minor housekeeping.

This project is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the [GNU General Public License](/LICENSE). If you have improvements, contributions to the [original](https://github.com/snwh/fedora-post-install) are much appreciated.

## Organization

This project is designed to be fairly modular (and not be one huge script) so you can easily delete or exclude bits/functions that you don't want to use.

 * [`data`](/data): files which are lists of packages<sup>&dagger;</sup> read by various functions.
 * [`functions`](/functions): the main functions of this scriptset. They should require little user-preference modification.
 * [`apps`](/functions/apps): functions for installing third-party applications. They are called in the [`install_thirdparty`](/functions/install_thirdparty) function.

*<sup>&dagger;</sup>These lists are preferential and you should to update them with packages you prefer*

## Adding Functions

Adding additional functions is as easy as editing one of the many already included functions and simply changing the variables. When you do add (or remove) functions be sure to update any main function (such as [`thirdparty`](/functions/thirdparty)) to reflect those changes.

## Usage

You use these scripts, you can just run the main script from the root of the source folder:

    ./fedora-post-install.sh

Alternatively, if you use `bash` and cloned this to your home folder, add the following to your `.bashrc` to run this script on-demand.

    export PATH=${PATH}:~/fedora-post-install/
